# CHROME-EXTENSION-FOR-TIME-TRACKING-AND-PRODUCTIVITY-ANALYTICS

COMPANY: CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: D M KARTHIK

INTERN ID: CITSOD783

DOMAIN: FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT

DURATION: 6 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

As an intern, I developed a simple Weekly Productivity Report web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this task was to display time spent on various websites during the week, and classify them as productive or unproductive. I used div elements dynamically generated via JavaScript to render each site entry, indicating how many minutes were spent and whether the usage was considered beneficial.

The UI includes a heading, a data display section, and a "Clear Data" button. On clicking the button, all report data is cleared from the display area. I also applied basic CSS styling to differentiate productive (green) and unproductive (red) usage visually, improving readability and UX.

This project was executed on JSFiddle, an online IDE that allowed me to test and debug code in real time without the need for local setup. It helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling in JavaScript, and dynamic content creation. Through this task, I improved my skills in front-end development, learned how to organize code modularly, and gained confidence in building interactive web components independently.

This was my first real-time implementation of code logic as part of an internship assignment.
